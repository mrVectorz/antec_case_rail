# Fork Modifications
Alteration to make this case rail work for my SSD carriers.
- Pins are 60mm apart instead of 4". 
- Added the `rounded_cube` module used.

# Antec Case Rail

Replacement rails for an Antec case.
I was repurposing one of my computers to be an [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) server, and while moving things around, I broke one of the rails that hold in the hard drives.
I looked at other rail designs on thingiverse, but couldn't find one I liked.
Beyond simply fitting the case, I wanted it to not take screws.
I could not find an existing rail that did both, so I created this rail.

Set the number of vertical perimeters so that the pin is solid plastic.
In my case, this meant increasing the value from 2 to 3 to get a solid pin.
